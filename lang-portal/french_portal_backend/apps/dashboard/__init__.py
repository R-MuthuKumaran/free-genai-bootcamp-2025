The first step in the implementation plan is to set up the project structure and initialize the Django project. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what we will do:

1. **Project Setup**
   - Create the root directory `french_portal`.
   - Initialize a Django project using `manage.py`.
   - Set up the main project configuration in the `french_portal` directory.

Once this is done, we can proceed to configure Django settings and URLs. Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this step or if you have a specific file you want to start with.
