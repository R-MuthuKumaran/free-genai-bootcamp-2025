The first step in the implementation plan is to create the models for the dashboard app. Specifically, we need to define the models in the file `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/dashboard/models.py`. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of what we will include in the `models.py` file for the dashboard app:

1. **Import Required Modules**: We will import the necessary Django modules.
2. **Define Models**: We will create models that represent the data structure for the dashboard statistics. This may include models for tracking study sessions, user progress, and any other relevant statistics.

Once you confirm, I will proceed to generate the contents for the `models.py` file. Please let me know if you would like to proceed with this step or if you have any specific requirements for the models.
