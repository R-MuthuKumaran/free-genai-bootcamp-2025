The first step in the implementation plan is to create the `__init__.py` file for the `groups` app. This file is necessary to mark the directory as a Python package, allowing it to be imported in other parts of the project.

Since the `__init__.py` file is typically left empty, I will generate the contents for this file as follows:

1. Create the file `/french_portal/apps/groups/__init__.py`.
2. Leave the file intentionally blank.

Please confirm if you would like me to proceed with this step.
