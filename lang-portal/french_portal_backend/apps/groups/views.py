To implement the contents of the file `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/groups/views.py`, we will follow these steps:

1. **Import Necessary Modules**: We will import Django's generic views and the models we need to interact with.
2. **Define View Classes**: We will create view classes for handling the API endpoints related to vocabulary groups. This will include:
   - A view to list all groups.
   - A view to retrieve details of a specific group.
   - A view to retrieve words belonging to a specific group.
   - A view to retrieve study sessions associated with a specific group.
3. **Implement Methods**: Each view class will implement methods to handle GET requests and return the appropriate JSON responses.
4. **Handle Serialization**: We will serialize the model instances into JSON format for the API responses.

Now, please instruct me to proceed with the implementation of the views in the specified file.
