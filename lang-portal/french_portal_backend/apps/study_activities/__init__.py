The first step in implementing the English to French Language Learning Portal is to create the contents of the `__init__.py` file for the `study_activities` app. This file is typically used to mark a directory as a Python package and can be left empty.

Here are the steps to follow for this implementation:

1. **Create the `__init__.py` file** in the `study_activities` directory.
2. **Leave the file intentionally blank** to indicate that it serves as a package marker.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with creating the `__init__.py` file for the `study_activities` app.
