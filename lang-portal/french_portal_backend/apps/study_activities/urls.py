To implement the contents of the file `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/study_activities/urls.py`, we will follow these steps:

1. **Import Required Modules**: Import Django's path function and the views from the `views.py` file in the `study_activities` app.

2. **Define URL Patterns**: Create a list of URL patterns that map to the views for the study activities endpoints as specified in the backend technical specifications.

3. **Set Up URL Routing**: Ensure that the URL patterns are correctly set up to handle the various API requests related to study activities.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the contents of the `urls.py` file:

- Import the necessary modules.
- Define the URL patterns for the following endpoints:
  - GET `/api/study_activities/:id` for retrieving a specific study activity.
  - GET `/api/study_activities/:id/study_sessions` for retrieving paginated study sessions for a study activity.
  - POST `/api/study_activities` for launching a new study activity.

Now, I will generate the contents for the `urls.py` file. Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this implementation.
