To implement the contents of the file `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/study_activities/views.py`, we will follow these steps:

1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Import Django's views and any required models from the `study_activities` app.
2. **Define View Functions**: Implement the view functions for handling the API endpoints related to study activities. This includes:
   - A function to retrieve detailed information about a specific study activity.
   - A function to retrieve paginated study sessions for a study activity.
   - A function to launch a new study activity.
3. **Handle Serialization**: Use Django REST Framework serializers to format the response data for the API.
4. **Add Error Handling**: Implement error handling for cases where study activities or sessions are not found.
5. **Return JSON Responses**: Ensure that the view functions return appropriate JSON responses.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this plan or if you have any specific instructions or modifications before I generate the code.
