The first step in the implementation plan is to create the contents of the file `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/study_sessions/__init__.py`. This file is typically used to mark the directory as a Python package and can be left intentionally blank.

Please confirm if you would like to proceed with creating this file as an empty file, or if you have any specific content you would like to include.
