To generate the contents of the file `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/study_sessions/admin.py`, we will follow these steps:

1. **Import Required Modules**: We will import the necessary modules from Django's admin framework.
2. **Import Models**: We will import the models defined in the `models.py` file of the `study_sessions` app.
3. **Register Models**: We will register the models with the Django admin site to make them manageable through the admin interface.

Now, please instruct me to proceed with the implementation of the `admin.py` file.
