To implement the English to French Language Learning Portal according to the provided backend specifications, we will start with the testing framework for the Study Sessions app. Hereâ€™s the plan for the contents of the `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/study_sessions/tests.py` file:

1. **Import Necessary Modules**: Import Django's testing tools and the models that will be tested.
2. **Create Test Case Class**: Define a test case class that inherits from `TestCase`.
3. **Set Up Test Data**: Use the `setUp` method to create any necessary test data, such as study sessions and related objects.
4. **Write Test Methods**: Implement various test methods to check the functionality of the study sessions, including:
   - Testing the creation of a study session.
   - Testing retrieval of study sessions.
   - Testing the association with words and groups.
5. **Assertions**: Use assertions to verify that the expected outcomes match the actual outcomes.

Now, I will generate the contents for the `tests.py` file based on this plan. Please confirm if you would like to proceed with this implementation or if you have any specific requirements for the tests.
