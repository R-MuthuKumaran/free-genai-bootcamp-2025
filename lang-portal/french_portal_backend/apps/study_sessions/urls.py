To implement the `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/study_sessions/urls.py` file, we will follow these steps:

1. **Import Necessary Modules**: We will import the `path` function from `django.urls` and the views from the `views.py` file in the `study_sessions` app.

2. **Define URL Patterns**: We will create a list of URL patterns that map specific endpoints to their corresponding view functions. This will include endpoints for retrieving study sessions, detailed information about a specific study session, and submitting word review results.

3. **Create the URL Configuration**: We will use the `urlpatterns` list to define the routing for the study sessions app.

Here is the plan for the contents of the `urls.py` file:

- Import the necessary modules.
- Define the URL patterns for the study sessions endpoints.
- Map each URL pattern to the corresponding view function.

Please instruct me to proceed with generating the contents of the `urls.py` file.
