To generate the contents of the file `/french_portal/french_portal/apps/words/urls.py`, we will follow these steps:

1. **Import Required Modules**: We will import the necessary modules from Django to set up URL routing.
2. **Define URL Patterns**: We will create a list of URL patterns that map to the views handling vocabulary-related endpoints.
3. **Include the Views**: We will reference the views that will handle the requests for each endpoint.

Hereâ€™s the plan for the contents of `urls.py`:

- Import `path` from `django.urls`.
- Import the views from the `views.py` file in the `words` app.
- Define the URL patterns for the following endpoints:
  - `GET /api/words`: To retrieve a paginated list of French vocabulary words.
  - `GET /api/words/:id`: To retrieve detailed information for a specific word.
  
Now, please instruct me to proceed with the implementation of the `urls.py` file.
