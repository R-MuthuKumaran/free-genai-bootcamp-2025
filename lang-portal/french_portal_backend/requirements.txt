To generate the contents of the `requirements.txt` file for the English to French Language Learning Portal, we will follow these steps:

1. **Identify Required Packages**: Based on the backend specifications, we need to include packages that are essential for a Django project, as well as any additional packages that may be useful for our specific implementation.

2. **List Packages**: The typical packages for a Django project include:
   - Django: The main framework for building the web application.
   - djangorestframework: For building RESTful APIs.
   - SQLite3: This is included with Python, so it doesn't need to be listed as a separate package.

3. **Version Specification**: It's a good practice to specify versions for the packages to ensure compatibility and stability.

4. **Format the File**: The `requirements.txt` file should list each package on a new line, optionally with version numbers.

Based on these steps, the contents of the `requirements.txt` file will be as follows:

- Django
- djangorestframework

Now, please instruct me to generate the contents for the `requirements.txt` file.
